#### "The Definitive Catalogue"

### About
- A curated selection of software, services and handwritten guides and recommendations that will help you to get the most out of your technology

### Why?
- There's a lot of information on the internet
- Sometimes it can be hard finding what you need or differentiating between what's good and bad
- This project aims to simplify that process so that you can spend more time using your technology rather than tinkering with it
