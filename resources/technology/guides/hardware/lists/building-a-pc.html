<h3>Building a PC</h3>
<h4>Prerequisites</h4>
<ol>
<li>Lay the parts on a large surface (e.g. a table)</li>
<li>Ground yourself by touching a large, metal object (e.g. a radiator)</li>
</ol>
<h4>Motherboard Preparation</h4>
<ol>
<li>Open the motherboard box and remove the motherboard from its anti-static bag</li>
<li>Close the motherboard box and place the motherboard on top</li>
<li>Open the CPU box and remove the CPU tray</li>
<li>Open the CPU socket by lifting the lever up and to the opposite side until you hear a click if on an AMD platform, or by pushing the latch down, out then lifting to the opposite side if on an Intel platform</li>
<li>Open the CPU tray and remove the CPU, holding it by the edges to not touch the pads or pins on the underside</li>
<li>Insert the CPU into the socket by aligning the arrow or dot on the socket with the arrow printed on the CPU</li>
<li>Close the socket in the reverse way it was opened. There may be some resistance if installing an Intel CPU</li>
<li>Remove the RAM from its packaging</li>
<li>Refer to the motherboard's manual to choose the correct slots to insert the DIMMs to enable the dual channel memory mode</li>
<li>Open the latches on the sides of the DIMM slots on the motherboard</li>
<li>Align the notch in the centre of the DIMM with the notch in the centre of the slot in the motherboard</li>
<li>Insert each stick one by one, pushing firmly on the edges of the stick to seat it within the slot, listening for a click to indicate successful installation</li>
<li>If installing an M.2 drive, remove it from the packaging</li>
<li>Refer to the motherboard's manual to choose the correct M.2 slot to install the drive to ensure correct compatibility (e.g. if a PCIe Gen 4 drive is being used, ensure that the drive is being installed into a PCIe Gen 4 compliant M.2 slot)</li>
<li>Unscrew the M.2 screw from the stand-off or if not pre-installed, find the M.2 screw in the motherboard box</li>
<li>Slide the pins of the M.2 drive into the slot with the label facing outwards</li>
<li>If the screw hole of the M.2 drive does not align with the stand-off, remove the drive and move the stand-off to a different hole on the board</li>
<li>Screw the M.2 drive into the slot</li>
<li>If using a stock or aftermarket air cooler, remove the cooler from its packaging</li>
<li>If using a liquid cooler, leave it in the packaging for now and skip the following 2 steps</li>
<li>Follow the instructions provided with the cooler to ensure proper installation as each cooler will differ in technique</li>
<li>If thermal paste is not pre-applied to the cooler, apply aftermarket thermal paste by removing the syringe cap and pushing a pea-sized blob onto the centre of the CPU</li>
</ol>
<h4>Case Preparation</h4>
<ol>
<li>Remove the case from its packaging and remove the accessory box</li>
<li>Unscrew and remove both side-panels by unscrewing the thumbscrews on the side or rear of the side-panel depending on case model
<li>Remove the front-panel from the case if additional fans are going to be installed</li>
<li>Remove the accessory box from the case</li>
<li>Remove any additional fans from their packaging and screw them into the case using the included self-tapping screws</li>
<li>Lay the case on its side</li>
<li>If the motherboard does not have a pre-installed I/O shield, re-open the motherboard box and remove the I/O shield</li>
<li>Remove the I/O shield from its packet and install it in the correct orientation at the rear of the case</li>
<li>Open the case's accessories box and remove the screw packet</li>
<li>Open the screw packet and pour the screws into a container</li>
</ol>
<h4>Motherboard Mounting</h4>
<ol>
<li>Test-fit the motherboard into the case to ensure that all of the pre-installed motherboard stand-offs in the case align with the screw holes on the motherboard</li>
<li>If the test-fit is not successful, first use pliers to remove any misplaced stand-offs, then install them into the correct locations on the motherboard tray</li>
<li>If further stand-offs are required, sift through the screws in the container</li>
<li>Re-fit the motherboard into the case ensuring that the rear I/O aligns with the I/O shield</li>
<li>Use the curved circular screws to screw the motherboard into the motherboard tray</li>
<li>If using a liquid cooler, remove it from its packaging</li>
<li>Mount the radiator to the case. It is recommended to install this at the top, ensuring that the fans are facing inside the case to push air outwards</li>
<li>Follow the instructions provided with the cooler to ensure proper installation of the waterblock. Each cooler will differ in technique</li>
</ol>
<h4>Drives, Expansion Cards & Power Supply</h4>
<ol>
<li>Refer to the motherboard manual's front-panel connector layout and install the case front-panel connectors (power, reset, power LED, disk activity LED, front-panel audio and USB) to the motherboard</li>
<li>Open and mount any 2.5" or 3.5" drives to the drive bays using the hexagonal-shaped headed screws</li>
<li>If a 2.5" or 3.5" drive has been mounted, remove a SATA cable from the motherboard box and connect the drive to the motherboard's SATA ports</li>
<li>Remove the PSU from its packaging</li>
<li>Insert the PSU into the case and mount it inside the case using the included screws</li>
<li>Connect the 24-pin motherboard power cable from the PSU to the right side of the motherboard</li>
<li>Connect the 8-pin CPU EPS power cable from the PSU to the top left of the motherboard</li>
<li>If your motherboard only has a 4-pin EPS power connector, split the 8-pin from the PSU into two halves and insert the half which fits</li>
<li>Connect the SATA power cables from the PSU to any installed 2.5" or 3.5" drives</li>
<li>If installing a discrete graphics card, remove it from its packaging</li>
<li>Remove the PCI blanking plates from the case corresponding to the 16X slot, and any additional depending on GPU width</li>
<li>Remove the plastic cover over the PCI-E 16X connector on the graphics card if present</li>
<li>Push the GPU into the motherboard's PCI-E 16X slot</li>
<li>Screw the graphics card into the case using the hexagonal-shaped headed screws</li>
<li>Connect any PCI-E peripheral power connectors from the PSU to the GPU if required, splitting the 8-pin connector apart if only 6-pins are required</li>
<li>If installing a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth card, remove it from its packaging</li>
<li>Remove the PCI blanking plate from the case corresponding to the 1x slot into which the card is to be installed on the motherboard</li>
<li>Insert the card into the PCI-E 1x slot of the motherboard</li>
<li>Screw the Wi-Fi or Bluetooth card into the case using the hexagonal-shaped headed screws</li>
</ol>
<h4>Finishing Touches</h4>
<ol>
<li>Using zip ties or velcro straps, tie down as many cables as possible at the rear of the motherboard tray</li>
<li>Re-install the front and side-panels in the reverse way by which they were removed</li>
<li>Connect a mouse, keyboard and monitor to the computer, ensuring to plug the monitor into the graphics card and not the motherboard if a discrete GPU is being used</li>
<li>Remove the kettle lead from the PSU box and plug the motherboard into the mains</li>
<li>Flick the switch on the back of the PSU to the on position and press the power button</li>
<li>Wait for the PC to POST, while repeatedly pressing the BIOS key on the keyboard to enter the BIOS. This may take up to a minute on first boot. See <a href="../../../../../resources/technology/guides/software/lists/bios-keys.html">here</a> for a list of BIOS keys</li>
<li>Verify that the CPU, RAM, and all drives are correctly detected</li>
<li>Shut down the PC by holding the power button</li>
 </ol>
